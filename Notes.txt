=== { User stories } ===
User Story: I am presented with a random series of button presses.
User Story: Each time I input a series of button presses correctly, I see the same series of button presses but with an additional step.
User Story: I hear a sound that corresponds to each button both when the series of button presses plays, and when I personally press a button.
User Story: If I press the wrong button, I am notified that I have done so, and that series of button presses starts again to remind me of the pattern so I can try again.
User Story: I can see how many steps are in the current series of button presses.
User Story: If I want to restart, I can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step.
User Story: I can play in strict mode where if I get a button press wrong, it notifies me that I have done so, and the game restarts at a new random series of button presses.
User Story: I can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct. I am notified of my victory, then the game starts over.

Resize issue

Inner/outer height, width, combine with resize.

http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/tryit.asp?filename=tryjsref_win_innerheight

Combined here's how it works, implement and change CSS based on the resize. vw or vh

window.addEventListener("resize", myFunction);

function myFunction() {
    var w = window.innerWidth;
    var h = window.innerHeight;
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Width: " + w + "<br>Height: " + h;
if (w > h) console.log('Width = larger');
else console.log('height = larger');
}
